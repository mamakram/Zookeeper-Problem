      <!--l. 27-->
      <p class="noindent" align="justify"> 
        The shortest path between two points in a simple polygon is the first step that should be implemented to solve the problem. In order to compute such a shortest path, we first need to find a path (not necessarily the shortest one) that connects the two points. So as to find this path, we should compute the dual graph of the polygon. The dual is a graph of triangles, in form of a tree. There exists a connection between two triangles in the dual if those two triangles share an edge in the triangulated polygon.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>  
        What interests us in the dual tree is the path between two special triangles of the triangulation : those which have an endpoint of the shortest path inside them. We find this path using the DFS in the graph, note that this path is unique because we consider a tree.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>  
        Now that we have a path inside our original polygon, we can proceed to the funnel algorithm.
        To do so, we first compute the list of segments of triangles crossed by our path. Then, advancing through our path, each time we cross one segment of this list with our path, we can update boundaries on the shortest path using the endpoints of the segment we crossed.

          <span class="titlemark"> 3.1 </span> <a id="x1-50002.1"></a>Basic Notions
        </h4>
        <p class="noindent" align="justify">
          Before we explain the funnel algorithm, let's check some notions together.
          <ul class="itemize1">
            <li class="itemize">
              First notion that we should know about is Topology. Topology refers to properties of geometric object which is unchangeable. For example consider a tape, the tape form is preservable against stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending but it is changeable against tearing. Topological space is a set of objects which has topological properties.<br>
            </li>
            <li class="itemize">
              Second interesting notion is homotopy. Two continous functions f, g from topological space X, to topological space Y are homotopic, if f can be continuously convert to g or if g can be continuously convert to f, such a conversion is called homotopy.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </figure>
        </center>
        <br>
        <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        So why these notions are important ? Let's return to our problem. Considering our shortest path problem and knowing an initial path, it can be shortened by pulling on it like a rope, while preserving its topology. This is exactly the logic behind the funnel algorithm.
      </p>
      <h4 class="subsectionHead">
        <span class="titlemark"> 3.2 </span> <a id="x1-50002.1"></a>Funnel Algorithm
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        Given a triangulated polygon, the source point, the destination point and an initial path p from the source to the destination. Our goal is to find the shortest homotopic path to p which goes from the source to the destination. Maybe you wonder why the algorithm is called funnel. In fact the algorithm is composed of two boundaries, a left side boundary and a right side boundary. These two boundaries are connected to each other from one endpoint (source point at the beginning) which creates an image similar to a funnel.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>
        At each iteration we try to tighten the bottleneck of this funnel in respect to the edges that have been crossed by path p (green). Once the left side boundary coincides on the right side boundary or vice versa, we found a portion of the shortest path and we restart the funnel process from the last point of this portion (this point is called the apex) until we reach the destination point.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>
        Consider the following example,

              Let s = C<sub>0</sub> , C<sub>1</sub> , ...,  C<sub>k</sub>  be the order in which s and the convex polygons in the set of cages are first visited in a counterclockwise scan of the boundary of P (the zoo). <br>
              Then there is a shortest zookeeper route that visits the cages in the set of cages in that same order. <br>

        </div>
      </p>
      <p class="noindent">
        This is actually quite easy to figure out. <br>
        Imagine it's not true and there is a shortest zookeeper's route that intersects itself at some point. (cfr. figure below)

      <p class="noindent">
        In such a path, the intersection create two triangles which are clossed by the dotted lines in the next figure. <br>
        We realize that for both of such triangles, we consider the two sides that are not the hypotenuse instead of the hypotenuse, which is obviously not the shortest path. <br>

      <p class="noindent">
        As the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle is always shorter than the sum of the lengths of the two other sides, and as all cages are still considered in the new path, 
        we can shorten the zookeeper's route by passing through the two hypotenuses we did not consider before. <br>
        Therefore, a route that intersects itself cannot exist, we get that the shortest route is considered in the order the cages are given on the boundary of the polygon, from s to s.

        <p>
          Now that we know in which order we have to consider the cages of the zoo, let us introduce another tool we need to compute the zookeeper's path : the supportings chains. <br>
          A supporting chain is a chain defined between two cages, C<sub>i</sub> and C<sub>i+1</sub> that goes from the starting vertex of C<sub>i</sub> to the last vertex of C<sub>i+1</sub>. <br>
          In particular, this chain is the shortest path between those two points. We compute it using the funnel algorithm.<br>
          Let us aswell define two points, let b := the point of the chain leaving the cage C<sub>i</sub>, and let a := the first point to touch C<sub>i+1</sub>.

        <p>
          We will now use those supporting chains to identify, for each cage, the edge considered in the final shortest zookeeper's route. <br>
          To do so, we compute the supporting chains from C<sub>i</sub> to C<sub>i+1</sub>, where s is consider to be C<sub>0</sub> and C<sub>n+1</sub> for all of our n cages. In particular, this identify the points a and b for each cage.<br>
          We can now interest ourselfs in another lemma stated by Chin and Ntafos : <br>

              <span class="underline">Lemma </span>: <br>
            If a &#8805; b, then any shortest zookeeper's route R either reflects on a point between a and b, or it wraps around C<sub>i</sub> and has at least one point of contact between a and b. <br>
            If a &#60; b, all points between a and b are also in R.<br>

          For C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> : a comes after b. Therefore, the final zookeeper's route will hit those cages somewhere between a and b. <br>
          For C<sub>1</sub> : a comes before b. Therefore, all points between a and b for C<sub>1</sub> are part of the final zookeeper's route. <br>

            For a &#8805; b, imagine the zookeper's route does not reflect between the two points. Then, the zookeeper's route must wrap around at least one of the two points of the cage to reach the next cage, which would create a longer path and contradict the lemma.<br>
          
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">
            For a &#60; b, the only way not to consider all the points between a and b is to break contact and then return to the chain, which creates a longer route.<br>
          As we know that the cages are to be considered in the order of the boundary of the zoo, we cannot access the cage from another point than a (which is the closest from the last cage) as it would create a longer route aswell. <br>
          
          </li>
          
        </ul>
        <p>
          The whole lemma is therefore true.

          Implication of this lemma :
          <div style="background: ghostwhite; 
            font-size: 16px; 
            padding: 10px;

            margin: 10px;">

            <p>
             
            Cages where a &#60; b can be treated as obstacles to the path as the funnel between the cage before and the cage after will consider all the points of this cage correctly anyway.<br>

        Rules: Place the desired number of Cages (a.k.a convex hulls) on the
        Polygon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by placing two points on the Polygon edges (these points must form
        a convex chain of vertices across the Polygon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, place as many points as you want inside the Polygon, press create
        Cage when done to form a convex Cage with the set of points and the two
        points on the Polygon

        NOTE: 
        The Show Funnel button is a temporary button for the funnel algorithm in developpement. 
        It displays :
        <ul class="itemize1">
          <li class="itemize">
            the triangulation of the polygon,
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">
            the approximate shortest path between the 2 fixed points s and t (in red), 
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">
            the segments crossed by the path (in green)
          </li>
        </ul>
        The actual shortest path is still to be computed using the funnel algorithm.
