        a Simple Polygon
      </h3>
      <!--l. 27-->
      <p class="noindent" align="justify"> 
        The shortest path between two points in a simple polygon is the first step that should be implemented to solve the problem. In order to compute such a shortest path, we first need to find a path (not necessarily the shortest one) that connects the two points. So as to find this path, we should compute the dual graph of the polygon. The dual is a graph of triangles, in form of a tree. There exists a connection between two triangles in the dual if those two triangles share an edge in the triangulated polygon.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>  
        What interests us in the dual tree is the path between two special triangles of the triangulation : those which have an endpoint of the shortest path inside them. We find this path using the DFS in the graph, note that this path is unique because we consider a tree.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>  
        Now that we have a path inside our original polygon, we can proceed to the funnel algorithm.
        To do so, we first compute the list of segments of triangles crossed by our path. Then, advancing through our path, each time we cross one segment of this list with our path, we can update boundaries on the shortest path using the endpoints of the segment we crossed.

          <span class="titlemark"> 3.1 </span> <a id="x1-50002.1"></a>Basic Notions
        </h4>
        <p class="noindent" align="justify">
          Before we explain the funnel algorithm, let's check some notions together.
          <ul class="itemize1">
            <li class="itemize">
              First notion that we should know about is Topology. Topology refers to properties of geometric object which is unchangeable. For example consider a tape, the tape form is preservable against stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending but it is changeable against tearing. Topological space is a set of objects which has topological properties.<br>
            </li>
            <li class="itemize">
              Second interesting notion is homotopy. Two continous functions f, g from topological space X, to topological space Y are homotopic, if f can be continuously convert to g or if g can be continuously convert to f, such a conversion is called homotopy.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </figure>
        </center>
        <br>
        <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        So why these notions are important ? Let's return to our problem. Considering our shortest path problem and knowing an initial path, it can be shortened by pulling on it like a rope, while preserving its topology. This is exactly the logic behind the funnel algorithm.
      </p>
      <h4 class="subsectionHead">
        <span class="titlemark"> 3.2 </span> <a id="x1-50002.1"></a>Funnel Algorithm
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        Given a triangulated polygon, the source point, the destination point and an initial path p from the source to the destination. Our goal is to find the shortest homotopic path to p which goes from the source to the destination. Maybe you wonder why the algorithm is called funnel. In fact the algorithm is composed of two boundaries, a left side boundary and a right side boundary. These two boundaries are connected to each other from one endpoint (source point at the beginning) which creates an image similar to a funnel.
        <br class="newline"/>  
        <br class="newline"/>
        At each iteration we try to tighten the bottleneck of this funnel in respect to the edges that have been crossed by path p (green). Once the left side boundary coincides on the right side boundary or vice versa, we found a portion of the shortest path and we restart the funnel process from the last point of this portion (this point is called the apex) until we reach the destination point.

        <b>Iteration 3: </b> Now in order to tighten our funnel by considering the next crossed edge (BG), we can not move the left boundary, as it is at the left most position compared to the apex and respecting to BG.

        Wei-Pang Chin and Simeon Stafos stated in their article "The zookeeper route problem" the following lemma : <br>

              <span class="underline">Lemma </span>: <br>
              Let Ω = C<sub>0</sub> , C<sub>1</sub> , ...,  C<sub>k</sub>  be the order in which s and the convex polygons (the cages) are first visited in a counterclockwise scan of the boundary of P (the zoo). <br>
              Then there is a shortest zookeeper route that visits the cages in the set of cages in that same order. <br>

      </p>
      <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        This is actually quite easy to figure out. <br>
        Imagine it's not true and there is a shortest zookeeper's route that intersects itself at some point. (cfr. figure below)

      <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        In such a path, the intersection create two triangles which are clossed by the dotted lines in the next figure. <br>
        We realize that for both of such triangles, we consider the two sides that are not the hypotenuse instead of the hypotenuse, which is obviously not the shortest path. <br>

      <p class="noindent" align="justify">
        As the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle is always shorter than the sum of the lengths of the two other sides, and as all cages are still considered in the new path, 
        we can shorten the zookeeper's route by passing through the two hypotenuses we did not consider before. <br>
        Therefore, a route that intersects itself cannot exist, we get that the shortest route is considered in the order the cages are given on the boundary of the polygon, from s to s.

              For a &#8805; b, imagine the zookeeper's route does not reflect between the two points. Then, the zookeeper's route must wrap around at least one of the two points a or b of one cage to reach the next cage, which would create a longer path and contradict the lemma.<br>

              For a &#60; b, the only way not to consider all the points between a and b is to break contact and then return to the chain, which creates a longer route.<br>
            As we know that the cages are to be considered in the order of the boundary of the zoo, we cannot access the cage from another point than a (which is the closest from the last cage) as it would create a longer route aswell. <br>

        </h4>
          <p align="justify">
            Now that we are conviced of the previous lemma, we know for sure that when the path contacts the cage, it occurs on one of the segments between b and a. Let's identify on which edge it occurs.<br>
          
            There are two easy scenarios : 
          <ul class="itemize1">
            <li class="itemize">
              When b and a stand on the same edge, we identify that edge as the contacting edge, and
            </li>
            <li class="itemize">
              When a and b are on the same vertex, the junction point is exactly this vertex.
            </li>
            
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            However, when there are multiple edge, we need to choose carefully the edge we are visiting. <br>
            Let e<sub>ib</sub> be the edge that goes from b to b+1 on the cage i, and let e<sub>i(a-1)</sub> be the edge that goes from a-1 to b on the cage i (remind that the vertices of the cages are sorted clockwise). <br>
            As we consider the cages in counterclockwise order and sorted around the chair, we have to alternate the position of the junction points between the edges e<sub>ib</sub> and e<sub>i(a-1)</sub>, 
            which are the edge that are locally the closest to the cage i+1. To do so, we observe the parity i &#8712; {1, ..., n} of our n cages. When i is odd, 
            the point that contacts C<sub>i</sub> has to be on the edge e<sub>i(a-1)</sub>. Respectively, when i is even, the point that contacts C<sub>i</sub> has to 
            be on the edge e<sub>ib</sub>. <br>
            Now that we have identify the edges we needed, let's aproximate that the shortest path between all the cages of the zoo is obtained by connecting the middle point of
            every identified edge. <br>

        <p align="justify">
          Now we know on which edge R<sub>0</sub> passes in each cage. We can try to find the exact contact point between these edges and R<sub>0</sub>. Let E be the set of edges of each cage that will be visited by R<sub>0</sub>. Let's call these edges u (u<sub>i</sub> for cage C<sub>i</sub>). The shortest route which visits all u<sub>i</sub> in E can be computed as follow: <br>

          Now the new problem is to find the shortest path from a point x to the point x' (itself) inside a simple polygon. This problem can be solved easily by using the Funnel algorithm which has been described in section 3. Once this process finishes, the route R<sub>0</sub> can be obtained by bending back the unrolled polygon. Let's call this process T. The following image illustrates the process T step by step:

            <p align="justify">
              The R0 obtained using the reflection method is only the first version of the shortest path. This path can however still be adjusted further through an iterative adjustment method.<br> 
              For each cage in the path, we can compute an adjustment coefficient we will call A<sub>ij</sub>, that lets us know whether the point of intersection of R0 on the cage can be moved to left or the right to shorten the path.<br> 
              To find A<sub>ij</sub>, we start by taking the two vectors going away from the point and following the edges of the path on either side of the point:

              </center>  
            <p align="justify">
              Once we normalize these two vectors and project them onto the edge of the cage containing our point v<sub>ij</sub>, we can compute A<sub>ij</sub> by calculating their sum:

          <p align="justify">
            Now that we know how to compute the A<sub>ij</sub> coefficient for every point touching a cage in R0, our algorithm to shorten the path goes as follows:

                In conclusion, the Zookeeper's route problem is a problem that requires a lot of simple tools in polygons : triangulion, convex hull computation, dual graph computation, shortest path between two points in polygon, reflection, and many more.
                All these tools need to be combined in insightful ways to solve the problem.

      <p>
        <strong>Rules:</strong> <br>
        Place the desired number of Cages (a.k.a convex hulls) on the
        Polygon.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do so, start by placing two points on the Polygon edges (these points must form
        a convex chain of vertices across the Polygon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, place as many points as you want inside the Polygon. When you are done, press "Create
        Cage" to form a convex Cage with the set of points and the two
        points on the Polygon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeat as many times as you want to create multiple cages. When you are done, press "Compute Zookeeper path" and choose a point on the border
        of Poly Daiza (your favorite zoo-lygon) that will be the chair of the zookeeper. Once the chair point is chosen, the zookeeper route is displayed.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        You have the possibility to swap the rendering of the zookeeper's route so as to show the supporting chains used to compute it by pressing "Swap R0/SuppChain".
      </p>  

      <p>
        At any time, whether there are cages or not, you can use a tool to visualize the shortest path between to points in a polygon. To do so, press "Shortest path" and
        place 2 points inside the zoo.  
        This is compute using the funnel algorithm describe in the explanation section.
